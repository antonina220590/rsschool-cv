## About me
Couple of months ago I decided to try myself in site layouting. As I have never ever studied programming languages I did my first layouts in the cms Joomla. Then I understood that I really like the process and I can improve my skills thanks to css, html and JavaScript. This is a main reason why I have decided to learn this programming languages in RS school.
I believe that my ability to learn, my purposefulness and luckiness will help me to become a succeful Frontend Developer.
